                    Therefore, we are constantly reviewing our data processing activities and revising our policies
                    in accordance with the applicable legislation in our present markets.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This Privacy Policy and Data Processing Principles <b>(“Privacy Policy”)</b> in our company websites
                    <b>(“Websites”)</b> are also reviewed in accordance with General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”)
                    and Californian Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) applies to all Websites, apps, events and to any other

                </p>
                <b>1. Data Processing Principles</b>
                <p>
                    <b>a. Information Automatically Collected.</b>
                    When you access our Websites, we and our possible third party partners automatically record information
                    from your device and its software, such as your IP address, browser type, Internet service provider,
                    platform type, the site from which you came and the site to which you are going when you leave our website,
                    date and time stamp and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser or your account.
                    When you access our Services using a mobile device, we may also receive or collect identification
                    numbers associated with your device (such as a unique device ID, IDFA, Google AdID), device type,
                    model and manufacturer, mobile device operating system brand and model, phone number, email address,
                    and other apps that you have downloaded <b>("Technical Data")</b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>b. Location Data.</b>
                    We do not currently collect your precise geolocation or any latitude or longitude coordinates for you.
                    Some of the information we collect, for example an IP address, can sometimes be used to approximate a
                    device’s location. In some cases, we assign the latitude and longitude of the centre of a city or state
                    on record for you to your profile as a way to improve our analytics and offer best matches for you.
                    This is a general latitude and longitude and does not correspond to your real time or historical location
                    specifically.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>c. Information Provided by Others.</b>
                    We may link or combine the personal data we collect about you and the information we collect automatically.
                    This allows us to provide you with a personalised experience regardless of how you interact with us.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>d. Anonymization.</b>
                    We may anonymise and aggregate any of the personal data we collect (so that it does not directly identify you).
                    We may use anonymised information for our business purposes including testing our IT systems, research,
                    data analysis, improving our services and developing new products and features. We may also share
                    such anonymised information with others.
                </p>
                <p>Where you do not provide the personal data, we may not be able to provide you the related services; as it may depend on this information.</p>
                <b>2. How & What Personal Information We Collect and How We Use:</b>

                <b>How and Why We Use:</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        We provide accurate business data to our customer to promote their goods and services using
                        direct marketing to the right people (decision makers, influencers, champions etc.);
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Promoting your business in the web searches,
                    </li>
                    <li>Enabling you to interact with features or tools on our platform such as live chat;</li>
                    <li>Providing you our existing and new services,</li>
                    <li>Improving your user experience and our features;</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    We will not collect additional categories of personal information or use the personal information
                    we collected for materially different, unrelated, or incompatible purposes without providing prior
                    notice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The main reason we use your information is to deliver what we offer and constantly improve our services.
                    Additionally, we use your information to help keep you safe and to provide you with advertising that
                    may be of interest to you.
                </p>
                <p>Besides, in line with the aforementioned, we may also use your personal data in the following circumstances:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Where you have given consent for us to use your personal data, for the stated purposes like;
                        marketing, sales and any sort of informative reasons
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and your interests
                        and fundamental rights do not override those interests.
                    </li>
                    <li>Where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligations.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    When the public area of the website is used, the user’s automatically anonymised IP address is saved.
                    As a result of the anonymization, it is impossible to identify the anonymised user and tracking their
                    movement on the website does not allow for any conclusions to be drawn about a specific user.
                </p>
                <b>3. Withdrawing your Consent or Request of Deletion</b>
                
                <b>4. Marketing Purposes and Newsletter</b>
                <p>
                    From time to time we may contact you with relevant information about our services and products.
                    Most messages we send will be by email. For some messages, we may use personal data we collect about
                    you to help us determine the most relevant information to share with you.
                </p>
                <b>Newsletter</b>
                <p>
                    We only contact you once you will provide us your name-surname and e-mail address, which will be
                    deemed as explicit consent to subscribe to our Newsletter.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We use the double opt-in process for our newsletter registration. This means that after your
                    registration we send an email to the email address specified by you; in this email we request
                    your confirmation that you desire to be sent the newsletter. If you do not confirm your registration
                    within 24 hours your data is automatically deleted. Furthermore, we also save your used IP addresses
                    and the times of your registration and confirmation. The purpose of this process is to verify your
                    registration and to possibly explain any mis-usage of your personal data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you do not want to receive Newsletters and other messages from us, you will be able to tell
                    us by selecting certain boxes on forms we use when we first collect your contact details. You can

                    or sending an e-mail to us.

                    To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature,
                    and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure
                    of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data, and whether we can
                    achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.

                <b>9. Your Rights under GDPR and under CCPA</b>
                <p>You may have certain rights under GDPR in relation to your personal data. You have the rights to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a “data subject access request”).
                        This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we
                        are lawfully processing it.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any
                        incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the
                        accuracy of the new data you provide to us.

                    <li>
                        Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal

                        Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest
                        (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes
                        you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental
                        rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal
                        data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling

                        Request restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend
                        the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish
                        the accuracy of the personal data; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want
                        us to erase it; (c) where we no longer need the personal data for the purposes set out above,
                        but we are required by you for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; or (d)
                        you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding
                        legitimate grounds to use it.

                    <li>

                        or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable
                        format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided
                        consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
                    </li>

                        Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data.
                        However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw
                        your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain features of
                        the services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.

                <b>Right to Opt-Out of Sale or Sharing of Personal Information:</b>
                <p>
                    According to CCPA, you have the following rights to exercise anytime you wish and therefore we
                    pledge to comply with the following accordingly;
                </p>
                <p>
                    (a) to direct a business that sells or shares personal information about the consumer to third
                    parties not to sell or share the consumer’s personal information. This right may be referred to
                    as the right to opt-out of sale or sharing.
                    (b) A business that sells consumers’ personal information to, or shares it with, third parties
                    shall provide notice to consumers, pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 1798.135, that this
                    information may be sold or shared and that consumers have the “right to opt-out” of the sale or
                    sharing of their personal information.
                    (c) Notwithstanding subdivision (a), a business shall not sell or share the personal information
                    of consumers if the business has actual knowledge that the consumer is less than 16 years of age,
                    unless the consumer, in the case of consumers at least 13 years of age and less than 16 years of
                    age, or the consumer’s parent or guardian, in the case of consumers who are less than 13 years of
                    age, has affirmatively authorized the sale or sharing of the consumer’s personal information.
                    A business that willfully disregards the consumer’s age shall be deemed to have had actual
                    knowledge of the consumer’s age.
                    (d) A business that has received direction from a consumer not to sell or share the consumer’s
                    personal information or, in the case of a minor consumer’s personal information has not received
                    consent to sell or share the minor consumer’s personal information, shall be prohibited, pursuant
                    to paragraph (4) of subdivision (c) of Section 1798.135, from selling or sharing the consumer’s
                    personal information after its receipt of the consumer’s direction, unless the consumer subsequently
                    provides consent, for the sale or sharing of the consumer’s personal information.
