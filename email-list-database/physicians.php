            <p>If you want to place a test order for our doctors email list and then move on to a much bigger one, we can help make sure you don't get any duplicates. Our online tool has a special function called "deduping," which will ensure that all of the contacts in your test order are net-new, and not included in any orders you place later. Just place your first order using our platform. We'll enable the deduping feature for you so all future email lists will only include contacts that weren't included in your previous orders.</p>

               <p><em>"When we decided to start a new marketing campaign, we knew one of the first places we'd have to start was by building a list of doctors who might be interested in our new product line. It was going to take forever, though… or so we thought. That's before we discovered Bookyourdata.com, that is! We were able to build a targeted emailing list for our new product in seconds using their incredibly user-friendly website and database of over 1 million physicians. And the best part? It was actually cheaper than if we'd tried to do it ourselves! We were able to contact more people faster, without having to spend hours manually digging through online records—and in a way that wasn't going to break the bank. We've saved so much money on marketing costs with Bookyourdata.com."</em><br></p>

               <p><em>"I started my wellness clinic a few months ago. I was having trouble getting in touch with the right doctors to get them to refer their patients to me. I tried googling for a physicians email list and came across Bookyourdata.com. They offered me a list of over 2000 doctors and gave me the option to download it in an excel spreadsheet. I was shocked by how easy it was to find the email addresses and contact information for physicians in my area, and for the price that I paid, I got access to so much more than the website prices. You can use the tool to get data to send emails, make phone calls, text messages, or even mail postcards!"</em></p>

               <p><em>"I'm a recruiter for pharmaceuticals, and I've been using BookYourData for a little over a year. My team is constantly looking for physicians to participate in clinical trials, and we need to be able to reach out to them efficiently. The first time I used BookYourData was when our company was testing out a new drug that treats diabetes. We needed to get in touch with endocrinologists, so the fact that they have a database of doctors sorted by specialty was incredibly useful. We also needed to find doctors who worked in clinics and not hospitals, so the ability to select by practice type made our recruitment efforts go much faster than when we used other providers. BookYourData has become one of my favorite tools and I recommend it to all my friends in the industry."</em><br></p>

               <p><em>"When I saw bookyourdata for the first time, I thought "Wait a minute. We don't have time for stuff like this." Our business is about bringing products to market for doctors and hospitals, so we have to be fast. Like, now-now. We don't have time or money to waste on a process that takes forever and costs a fortune. But then I realized that Bookyourdata was the answer to my prayers! It's just so easy—I can build an email list in seconds. And with a fair price. How could I say no? The best part? When we're done with one campaign, it's easy enough to build another list right away. We're not stuck in some long-term contract with some other vendors, only able to get what we need when our term is up—we can be as flexible as we want with the email list, and that's the kind of freedom we need on our team."</em></p>
