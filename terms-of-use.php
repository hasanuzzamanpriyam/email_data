                    be used in the future. The User enters into a binding purchase contract by processing their order
                    and purchased credits are non-refundable. User may also have the option to enter into a subscription
                    contract for a set term in which the user will be charged the current subscription rate and their
                    account will be credited with the corresponding number of credits. If a User selects a subscription
                    option, User enters into a binding purchase contract for the corresponding period of time by processing
                    their order. Subsequent payments will automatically be billed to User’s provided method of payment on

                    annual subscription). Additionally, User has the option to save their credit card information to their
                    account to be used for any other purchases. All payments are processed by the Company’s third-party
                    payment processor and payment information will also be stored by the payment processor. User understands
                    and agrees that Company is not liable for the storage of information by the payment processor. The User
                    further affirms that the name, personal and financial information provided before the sale are true
                    and correct. The Company shall not be liable in the event that the Data is not usable as a
                    result of its failure to duly provide the necessary information.<br><br>
                    With regard to subscription packages, User will have the ability to enter into a contract
                    to obtain a set number of credits per month for a designated period of months.
                    For example, 10 credits per month for a period of 12 months for a total of 120 credits. User will
                    be charged a total fee for the subscription plan that will be divided into monthly payments
                    over the course of the subscription term. By enrolling in the subscription plan and
                    submitting payment information, User agrees that Company may automatically bill User for
                    the monthly subscription payment. Upon enrolling in the subscription plan, User enters into
                    a binding contract for the full term of the subscription plan and is responsible for full payment
                    of the total amount. If User fails to make the monthly payments, Company may take collections
                    actions, including legal action, against User. No refunds are available for subscription
                    plan purchases; however, credits do not expire.

                    through the Company’s Services shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than in court.

                    The use of the Word “arbitrator” in this provision shall not be construed to prohibit more than one arbitrator
                    from presiding over an arbitration: rather, the AAA’s rules will govern the number of arbitrators that may preside
                    over an arbitration conducted under this Agreement to Arbitrate. The Arbitration State be in New York, New York.</p>
